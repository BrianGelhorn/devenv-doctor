# Use Cases

## UC-001 - Check a local Docker/Compose project

### Principal Actor: Developer

### Secondary Actor: Docker Engine, Docker Compose, Local Filesystem

### Objective

As a Developer I want to know if the local project is `Ready` or `Not Ready` to run.

### Description:

The developer runs the CLI in a local project to analyze it and determine whether it is ready to run locally.

### Preconditions

- The CLI program is installed and available to execute.
- The Developer has access to the path of the project.

### Main flow:

1. The developer opens a terminal.
2. The developer runs `devenv-doctor check .`.
3. The CLI scans the local environment.
4. The CLI checks the Docker Compose file configurations.
5. The CLI checks the environment files.
6. The CLI checks the Dockerfiles of the used services.
7. The CLI displays the status as `Ready`
8. The CLI exits with code 0.

### Expected result:  
The developer understands whether the project is `Ready` or `Not Ready` to run locally.

### Alternative flows

#### AF-001: Docker is not available
- If Docker is not installed or cannot be executed, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-002: Docker daemon is not running
- If Docker daemon is not running or cannot be accessed, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-003: Docker Compose is not available
- If Docker Compose is not installed or cannot be accessed, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-004: Docker Compose file is missing
- If no Docker Compose file is found, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-005: Docker Compose file is invalid
- If the Docker Compose file cannot be parsed correctly as YAML, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-006: Docker Compose has duplicated host ports
- If the Docker Compose defines the same host port for different services, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-007: Docker Compose file has no services
- If the Docker Compose file does not define any service, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-008: A service `build` or `image` is missing
- If a service does not define either a `build` path or an `image` in the Docker Compose file, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-009: A service Dockerfile is missing
- If a service defines a build context path that exists but does not have Dockerfile, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-010: The environment file is missing
- If a required `env_file` does not exist or cannot be accessed, the CLI reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1.

#### AF-011: The defined port in Docker Compose is busy
- If a service defines a host port that is already being used by another process in the system, the CLI shows the used port, reports a blocking issue and marks the project as `Not Ready` and exits with code 1. 

#### AF-012: The `env.example` is missing or is not paired
- If the project does not have an `env.example`, the CLI reports a non-blocking issue and marks the project as `Ready with warnings` and exits with code 0.

#### AF-013: The CLI cannot complete the analysis due to an execution failure
- If the CLI cannot complete the analysis due to an uknown error during the execution, the CLI exits with code 2.

**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-005

### Description

Checks whether Docker Compose is installed and available.

### Pass condition

The command `docker compose version` returns successfully.

### Alternative pass condition

The command `docker-compose --version` returns successfully

### Fail condition

Neither `docker compose version` nor `docker-compose --version` can be executed successfully.


### Recommendation

## FILE-001 - Docker Compose file exists in project

**Category:** File  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-006

### Description

Checks whether a Docker Compose file exists in the project.

### Accepted Filenames

- `compose.yml`
- `compose.yaml`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.yaml`

### Pass condition

At least one accepted Compose file exists in the target project path.

### Fail condition

No accepted Compose file is in the target project path.


### Recommendation

Create a valid Docker Compose file or, if one already exists, rename it to one of the accepted filenames.

## FILE-002 - Dockerfile exists for services using build

**Category:** File  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-011

### Description

Checks whether a Dockerfile exists for each Compose service that uses `build`.

### Pass condition

Every service using `build` has a Dockerfile in the expected build context.


### Fail condition

At least one service using `build` does not have a valid Dockerfile in the expected build context


### Recommendation

Create a Dockerfile in the service build context or update the Compose `build` configuration to reference the correct Dockerfile path.

## CMP-001 - Docker Compose file has a valid yaml syntax

**Category:** Compose  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-007

### Description

Checks whether the detected Docker Compose file has valid YAML syntax.

### Pass condition

The Docker Compose file can be parsed as valid YAML.


### Fail condition

The Docker Compose file cannot be parsed because it contains one or more YAML syntax errors.


### Recommendation

Fix the YAML syntax errors in the Docker Compose file.

## CMP-002 - Docker Compose file has a non-empty `services` section

**Category:** Compose  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-008

### Description

Checks whether the detected Docker Compose file has a non empty `services` section

### Pass condition

The Docker Compose file has a `services` section and has atleast one service defined.


### Fail condition

The Docker Compose file does not have a `services` section or the `services` section is empty.

### Recommendation

Add a `services` section and define at least one service in the Docker Compose file.

## CMP-003 - Each Docker Compose service has a valid `image` or `build` 

**Category:** Compose  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-009

### Description

Checks whether each service of the detected Docker Compose file has a valid `build` or `image`.

### Pass condition

Every Docker Compose services defines either a `build` or `image`.


### Fail condition

At least one Docker Compose service does not defines either `build` or `image`.

### Recommendation

Add an `image` reference or a `build` configuration to each service.

## CMP-004 - Each Docker Compose build context reference exists.

**Category:** Compose  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-010

### Description

Checks whether each `build` context referenced by Docker Compose services points to an existing directory.

### Pass condition

Every Docker Compose service using `build` references an existing build context directory.

### Fail condition

At least one Docker Compose service using `build` references a build context that does not exist.

### Recommendation

Update the `build` context path to reference an existing directory.

## CMP-005 - Defined Docker Compose services have no duplicated host ports

**Category:** Compose  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-012

### Description

Checks whether host ports defined in the Docker Compose file are unique across all services.

### Pass condition

No host port is used by more than one Docker Compose service.

### Fail condition

At least one host port is used by multiple Docker Compose services.

### Recommendation

Change the duplicated host port so each exposed host port is unique.

## NET-001 - Host ports are available on the local system

**Category:** Networking  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-013

### Description

Checks whether host ports defined in the Docker Compose file are available on the local system.

### Pass condition

All host ports defined in the Docker Compose file are available.

### Fail condition

At least one host port defined in the Docker Compose file is already being used by another process.

### Recommendation

Change the affected host port in the Docker Compose file or stop the process that is using the port.

## ENV-001 - Host ports are available on the local system

**Category:** Networking  
**Severity:** Blocking  
**Related requirement:** FR-013

### Description

Checks whether host ports defined in the Docker Compose file are available on the local system.

### Pass condition

All host ports defined in the Docker Compose file are available.

### Fail condition

At least one host port defined in the Docker Compose file is already being used by another process.

### Recommendation

Change the affected host port in the Docker Compose file or stop the process that is using the port.
